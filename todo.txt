functionality:
- allow filtering by votes across multiple races (or single race for races with numVotes > 1). or choose multiple candidates in 1 race and compare how their voters voted in other races
- only hide contest with filtered candidate if numVotes for contest is 1! otherwise results are interesting

ui:
- also indicate diff in bar chart? maybe too noisy
- group options in candidate typeahead by contest?
- Separate races by type? Group presidential primaries, house, state leg, props, etc?
- Allow clicking on a candidate row to apply them as a filter?
- visually differentiate unknown vs other candidates. add explanation for that row
- clear typeahead if it has input but nothing selected on blur

data:
- RCV after rank 1 has IsVote = False. need to include that if we want to take 2nd, 3rd, etc choice into account

bugs:
- handle invalid election id in URL. maybe use election date instead? or just use default election instead
