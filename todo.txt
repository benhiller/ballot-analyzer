- visually differentiate unknown vs other candidates. add explanation for that row
- Allow clicking on a candidate row to apply them as a filter?
- Separate races by type? Group presidential primaries, house, state leg, props, etc?
- RCV after rank 1 has IsVote = False. need to include that if we want to take 2nd, 3rd, etc choice into account
- group options in candidate typeahead by contest?
- allow filtering by votes across multiple races
