functionality:
- allow filtering by votes across multiple races (or single race for races with numVotes > 1)
- choose multiple candidates in 1 race and compare how their voters voted in other races
- filter by ballot type (could be interesting for NPP vs registered dems in dem primary)

ui:
* tooltip explanation for unknown
* Allow clicking on a candidate row to apply them as a filter?
* also indicate diff in bar chart? maybe too noisy
- Separate races by type? Group presidential primaries, house, state leg, props, etc?
* test on iphone
  - try to break up rows into two rows on iphone?
- use 'tnum'?

data:
* generate DistrictPrecinctPortionManifest.json for 2019 results. should be same precincts as 2020 election, so it should be doable
- RCV after rank 1 has IsVote = False. need to include that if we want to take 2nd, 3rd, etc choice into account
- separate out undervotes when filtering

bugs:
- handle invalid election id in URL. maybe use election date instead? or just use default election instead

deploy:
- make sure election name + date are modified in Election manifest
