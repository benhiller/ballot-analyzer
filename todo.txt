functionality:
- allow filtering by votes across multiple races (or single race for races with numVotes > 1). or choose multiple candidates in 1 race and compare how their voters voted in other races
- only hide contest with filtered candidate if numVotes for contest is 1! otherwise results are interesting
- filter by precinct (or district?), ballot type (could be interesting for NPP vs registered dems in dem primary)

ui:
- also indicate diff in bar chart? maybe too noisy
- Separate races by type? Group presidential primaries, house, state leg, props, etc?
- Allow clicking on a candidate row to apply them as a filter?
- tooltip explanation for unknown
- polish name of election in filter dropdown
- test on iphone

data:
- RCV after rank 1 has IsVote = False. need to include that if we want to take 2nd, 3rd, etc choice into account
- separate out undervotes when filtering

bugs:
- handle invalid election id in URL. maybe use election date instead? or just use default election instead
